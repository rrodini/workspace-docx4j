INSTRUCTIONS TO VOTER
1.  TO VOTE YOU MUST
COMPLETELY BLACKEN THE   
OVAL (R) TO THE LEFT OF YOUR
CHOICE. An oval (R) blackened to
the left of any candidate indicates a
vote for that candidate.
2.  To vote a Straight Party Ticket,
completely darken the oval next to the
Party for which you wish to vote. This
will automatically cast a vote for all
candidates of your chosen Party, in all
contests. You may also vote for
candidate(s) of another Party, in a
specific contest, by completely
darkening the oval next to his or her
name. This action will not void your
Straight Party vote for other candidates,
in other contests.  
3.  To cast a write-in vote for a person
whose name is not on the ballot, you
must blacken the oval to the left of the
line provided, and print the name in the
blank space provided for that purpose.
4. To vote in FAVOR of a Question, fill
in the oval to the left of the word YES.
To vote AGAINST a Question, fill in the
oval to the left of the word NO.
